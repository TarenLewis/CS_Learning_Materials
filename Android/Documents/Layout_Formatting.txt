Chains

Chains are controlled by attributes set on the head of the chain.
The head is the element from which the chain was created.

Default behavior of a chain is to spread the elements equally in the available space. By assigning
weight and bias to elements you can control how they align.

Spread Chain:
Default, spreads elements equally.

Spread Inside Chain:
Uses all available space, with the head and tail glued to the parent (or walls)
eg. ||xx|     |xx|     |xx||

Weighted Chain:
Uses up all space, and resize elements to fill it based on the values in the layout constraint horizontal weight,
or layout constraint vertical weight attributes.
eg. ||xx|xxxxxxx|xxxx||

Packed Chain:
Uses the minimum space. You can use bias to move the group of elements on an axis.
eg. |     |xx|xx|xx|     |
with bias:
    |  |xx|xx|xx|        |
